Babel
*****

Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol roughly
based on HSDV and AODV, but with provisions for link cost estimation
and injection of external routes.


Installation
************

  $ make
  $ su -c 'make install'


Running Babel
*************

In order to run Babel on a node (wireless or wired), just give it an
IPv6 address, then run the routing daemon.  Assuming your wireless
interface is eth1, and your IPv6 address is $IPv6, do

  # ip -6 addr add $IPv6 dev eth1
  # babel $IPv6 eth1

If your node has multiple interfaces which you want to participate in
the Babel netowk, just list them all:

  # babel $IPv6 eth0 eth1 sit1

If your node has multiple addresses and you want all of them to
participate in the routing protocol, inject the other addresses as
zero-cost external routes:

  # babel -X $IPv6-2 0 -X $IPv6-3 0 $IPv6 eth1

On an access point, you'll probably want to inject external routes
into the Babel network.  First check that you have a default route
on your access point:

  $ ip -6 route show default
  default via ...

Then run the routing daemon as so:

  # babel -x default 256 $IPv6 eth1

If you find all of this too complicated and error-prone (as I do), you
may want to consider autoconfiguring your routing domain using AHCP:
